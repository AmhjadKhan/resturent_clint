## Project Overview
The Resturet Item Booking Project is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate the booking of restaurant items in a seamless and efficient manner. The application caters to both users and administrators, offering a range of features to manage bookings, payments, and user data.

### Key Features
1. **Authentication**: The application provides secure authentication using Firebase, allowing users to sign up and log in with their credentials. Authentication is crucial for protecting user data and ensuring only authorized access.

2. **Booking System**: Users can browse through available restaurant items and make bookings directly through the app. The intuitive booking system is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and clear interface.

3. **Payment Integration**: The app integrates with Stripe to handle payments securely. Users can make payments for their bookings with various payment methods, ensuring a smooth and safe transaction process.

4. **Role-Based Routes**: The application offers distinct routes for admins and users. Admins have access to a dashboard where they can manage all bookings, user accounts, and restaurant items. Users have their dashboard to track their bookings, view their payment history, and manage their account details.

5. **Dashboards**: The user dashboard provides a personalized space where users can view and manage their bookings. The admin dashboard offers comprehensive control over the entire system, including booking management, user management, and item management.
